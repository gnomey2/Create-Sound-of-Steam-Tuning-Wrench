currently only works on 1.20.1. Once I finish, Anonym or I will port it to 1.21. Does not work with base create whistles. Survival friendly except it doesn't have a crafting recipe yet, sorry.
I plan on releasing new versions soon™ that will make it better™. Updates will be on GitHub probably™

Update: Ported to 1.21.1 and Works with base create whistles now
