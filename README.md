## Requirements

## Installation

3. Right-click any Sound of Steam pipe with the wrench.
4. A Create redstone link is will be placed two blocks below the pipe, set to recieve and with the correct frequency.

Note: this is intended to be used with the windchests. it will not work with fluid tanks becaues it replaces the heat source

**Survival Use:** the wrench will take redstone links from your inventory when using. It will not work if there are none left.
